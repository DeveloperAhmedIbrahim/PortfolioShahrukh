                            Our company was founded in <b>2019</b> by a group of friends who shared a passion for software
                            engineering.
                            At the time, they were all working for different companies, but they shared a common goal: to
                            create
                            a company that would provide businesses with the tools they need to succeed online. They saw the
                            potential of the internet and wanted to help businesses take advantage of it.
                            The founders had different areas of expertise, which allowed them to create a well-rounded team.
                            They had experience in software development, digital marketing, and business management. They
                            knew
                            that these skills would be essential to the success of their company.
                            After months of planning and preparation, they finally launched their company. They started out
                            small, working out of a shared office space. But they had big dreams and a clear vision of what
                            they
                            wanted to achieve. They knew that they would face challenges along the way, but they were
                            determined
                            to succeed.

                            Like any new business, our company faced its share of challenges in the early days. One of the
                            biggest challenges was finding clients. They knew that they had the skills and expertise to help
                            businesses succeed online, but they needed to get the word out.
                            To overcome this challenge, they started attending networking events and reaching out to their
                            personal and professional networks. They offered free consultations and worked hard to build
                            relationships with potential clients. Slowly but surely, they began to build a client base.
                            Despite the challenges, our company had early successes that gave them the confidence they
                            needed to
                            keep going. They landed their first major client within the first year of launching. This was a
                            huge
                            milestone for the team and gave them the motivation they needed to keep pushing forward.They

                            To keep up with the demand, we had to grow our team. We started out with just a handful of
                            employees, but we now have a team of over 23 highly skilled professionals. We've hired some of
                            the

                                    However, my project took multiple delivery extensions because of its complication. Yet,
                                    they managed to deliver the results I was expecting from them. They are very supportive
                                    and solve your issues if you are not satisfied. I will love working again. Recommended
